# React-Forms-Exercise

### Testing Requirements

Make sure both of these apps have tests. Here are the guidelines for testing:

* Every component needs a smoke + snapshot test.
* Critical Business Logic needs tests too. Use your judgement for this, but make sure you cover core functionality. Examples include: the ability to enter data, submit a form, and have the desired outcome appear in the DOM.

### Part 1 - Color Box Maker

Create a new React application, which contains the following components:

* App - this component should render the BoxList component.
* BoxList - Place your state that contains all of the boxes here. This component should render all of the Box components along with the NewBoxForm component
* Box - this component should display a div with a background color, width and height based on the props passed to it.
* NewBoxForm - this component should render a form that when submitted, creates a new Box. You should be able to specify the Box’s width, height, and background color. When the form is submitted, clear the input values.
* When each Box component is displayed, add a button with the text of of “X” next to each Box. When this button is clicked, remove that specific box. This will require you to pass a function down as props - the button should not be a separate component, it should be included in the Box component.

### Part 2 - Todo App - List, Add, Remove Todos

Create a Todo App that allows users to see, add, edit, and remove todos. It should contain the following components.

* App - this component should render the TodoList component
* TodoList - this component should render the NewTodoForm component and should render the list of Todo components. Place your state that contains all of the todos in this component.
* NewTodoForm - this component should render a form with one text input for the task to be created. When this form is submitted, a new Todo component should be created. - Todo- this component should display a div with the task of the todo.
* For each Todo component, there should also be a button with the text “X” that when clicked, removes the todo.

### Further Study

* It’s time to edit some todos! Each Todo component should also display a button with the text “edit” that when clicked, displays form with the task of the todo as an input and a button to submit the form. When the form is submitted, the task of the text should be updated and the form should be hidden.
* When each Todo component is displayed, add a button with the text of “Mark as completed”. When this button is clicked, add a strike through the text of the todo.
* Instead of a button that when clicked adds a strike through, refactor your application so that when that button is clicked, if the todo is completed (something each todo will have in state), add a strike through, otherwise if a todo is not completed, remove the strike through.
* Add some styling to your application! Try to use a CSS animation that fades out a Todo when it is deleted (this will involve adding/removing CSS classes). Write this using SASS!
* Save your todos in localStorage and retrieve them when the page loads.
